    <p>The Chevrolet Corvette is a line of American two-door, two-seater luxury[1] sports cars, manufactured and marketed by GM, under the Chevrolet marque, since 1953.[2][3]

        Over the course of eight generations, indicated sequentially as C1 to C8, the Corvette is noted for its performance, distinctive styling, lightweight fiberglass or composite bodywork, and competitive pricing. Since the cessation of Ford and Chrysler's competitors,[4] the Corvette is the only two-seat sports car produced by a major United States auto manufacturer and serves as Chevrolet's halo car.[5]</p>

        <p class="font-style" >History</p>
        <p>The first generation of Corvette was introduced late in the 1953 <i>model year</i>, appearing as a show car for the 1953 General Motors Motorama, January 17â€“23 at <b>New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel</b>.[11] At the time, Chevrolet general manager Thomas H. Keating said it was six months to a year away from production readiness.[12] The car generated sufficient interest for mass production to begin on June 30, 1953</p>
